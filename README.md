# Minotaur: The Labrynth
## About:
>“The architecture of the Minotaur’s heart is ancient... It is a plodding laborious thing, built for churning through the millennia. But the blood it pumps—the blood it has pumped for five thousand years, the blood it will pump for the rest of his life—is nearly human blood. It carries with it, through his monster’s veins, the weighty, necessary, terrible stuff of human existence... But in the Minotaur’s world it is far easier to kill and devour seven virgins year after year, their rattling bones rising at his feet like a sea of cracked ice, than to accept tenderness and return it.”<br /><br /> -Steven Sherill, The Minotaur Takes a Cigarette Break

Thousands of years ago, outside of your town, lived a Minotaur blinded by an unqenchable, raging curse. He was locked inside an impenatrable dungeon, locked within the depths of the dark, lost abyss. It is your job, as Thesius, to hunt down this accursed monster and end the bloody violence forced upon your small town. Will you stop this curse, or be caught within the maze of the Labrynth?

### How to play
This is a simple game similar to PacMan. Use the arrow keys to navigate your character through the maze and pick up items to kill the Minotaur!
### The build!

## The Assets:
I drew all these assets myself with a [free MS Paint copy](https://jspaint.app/). Ideally, I'd love to use better graphics, but i only have a week for this short lil' project. 
## Bugs and unfinished functionalities I'll fix (eventually):
